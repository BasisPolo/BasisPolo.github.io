    <p>Hi! I'm Toby. Today, I'm a 9th grader at BASIS Independent Bellevue, participating in activities such as the <a href="usaco.org">United States of America Computing Olympiad</a>. But I wasn't always this way. In fact, before one event, I basically couldn't code at all.</p>
    <p>My experience coding started somewhere around third grade. Before this, my dad had shown me Python. He claims I could understand it, but from what I remember, it felt more like a mystery with a few commands from the <a href="https://py.processing.org/">processing library</a>, in a highly pixelated environment(somewhere around 20x20px). There was never really user interaction or input, so I'm not counting this as code.</p>
    <p>But in third grade, this changed. A library near me, which I went to often, hosted a "makerspace." They had a few activities, but the ones I was really able to do were using their 3d pen(maybe more on that later?) and code, specifically MIT Scratch. I was shown the basic movement commands, but then moved onto other things. However, when I got home, I really started to expirement.</p>
    <p>By 4th grade, I was very proficient in Scratch. My parents helped me make an <a href="  https://scratch.mit.edu/users/LetsGoToThePark/">actual account</a> so I could save my projects. Every day when I came home from school, if we weren't doing anything special, I would ask my parents, "Can I do Scratch?"</p>
