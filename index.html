    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Toby. Today, I'm a 9th grader at BASIS Independent Bellevue, participating in activities such as the <a href="https://usaco.org">United States of America Computing Olympiad</a>. But I wasn't always this way. In fact, before one event, I basically couldn't code at all.</p>
    <h3>The beginning</h3>
    <p>My experience coding started somewhere around third grade. Before this, my dad had shown me Python. He claims I could understand it, but from what I remember, it felt more like a mystery with a few commands from the <a href="https://py.processing.org/">processing library</a>, in a highly pixelated environment(somewhere around 20x20px). There was never really user interaction or input, so I'm not counting this as code.</p>
    <p>But in third grade, this changed. A library near me, which I went to often, hosted a "makerspace." They had a few activities, but the ones I was really able to do were using their 3d pen(maybe more on that later?) and code, specifically MIT Scratch. I was shown the basic movement commands, but then moved onto other things. However, when I got home, I really started to expirement.</p>
    <p>By 4th grade, I was very proficient in Scratch. My parents helped me make an <a href="  https://scratch.mit.edu/users/LetsGoToThePark/">actual account</a> so I could save my projects. Every day when I came home from school, if we weren't doing anything special, I would ask my parents, "Can I do Scratch?"</p>
    <h3>Coding Casually</h3>
    <p>Once I got good enough at Scratch, my dad deemed that it had begun to be a waste of my time. He taught me to code in Python &mdash; for real this time. I wasn't too good at it, but my creations can be found <a href="https://tfd98000-5029.trinket.io/sites/all-trinkets">here</a>, if anybody's interested.</p>
    <p>In 6th grade at school, we did Arduino code, in c++, for the first time. Midway through the unit, there was a break from school. My dad, having taught this sort of thing at the high school level, explained to me how to code in c++, at a very basic level &mdash; better than what I learned in school. When classes resumed and the things we were doing became more complex, I was the only one in the class who actually understood what was going on.</p>
    <p>That summer, I was trying to code a game in python without any libraries, just for fun. However, I wanted a way to clear the output. I didn't find anything immediately, so, being impatient, I decided to make a workaround. I learned HTML, reasoning that it must be possible that way.</p>
    <p>Through exclusively w3schools, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I got better and better, until I was proficient enough to code a website. I've uploaded two of my favorite creations: <a href="/bananagrams.html">bananagrams</a> and <a href="/boggle.html">boggle</a>. There are no instructions on either page(sorry if you want to play). For Boggle, I made it so if two people enter the same code at the beginning of the game, they will see identical boards. That way, I could play against my mom, for example.</p>
    <h3>High School</h3>
    <p>At this point, I thought I was good at coding. I was at an advanced school by now (BASIS), and I could code better than most of the people in my class, even some who did competitions. Then in 9th grade, I joined my school's competitive coding club for USACO. Now, I see how I can improve, and have a long way to go. I've passed Bronze, but am still working on Silver.</p>
