    <p>Hi! I'm Toby. Here are my projects:</p>
    <p>Bananagrams: If you want to play bananagrams you can go <a href="/bananagrams.html">here</a>. Be aware: the dictionary is horrible (sorry), it never ends, and has no instructions. To move, click two tiles you want to swap. I made this in 7th grade or so, so no guaruntees everything works.</p>
    <p>Boggle: similar flaws to Bananagrams. Can be found <a href="/boggle.html">here</a></p>
